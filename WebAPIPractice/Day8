Method we writing now synchronously 

Sync-- wait for other methods to execute
Method()
{
Method1 10sec
method2 15 sec 
method3 5 sec 
}
sync 30 secs to run them for above 


Async-- parallel mode , this will be finished in 15 secs
.net core designed for Aync mode 


when writing async on

TimeSlicing
Task1
Task2
Task3  

public Task AddEmployee()/public Task AddEmployeeAsync(use this type for .net)
generic value --public Task<Employee> GetByIdAsync(int id)


EmployeeRepositoryAsync

GetByIdAsync(4);--- returns task of the employee 
await GetByIdAsync(4)l--returns  employee value 

using await means we need to use the async in method writing
public async Task<Employee> getById(int id)
await getByIdAsync(id)

when to use the microservice architeture or when to not use it
